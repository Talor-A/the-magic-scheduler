reworked the event date system.
events can now be created that start and end at a certain time,
as well as repeating until a certain date.

man, this date parsing stuff is hard, and I haven't even gotten into the
juicy details yet. I know I can make it all work though.

still WIP: retrieving instances in a date range of a repeating event.
